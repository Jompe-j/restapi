# restapi for course 1dv527 - Linneaus university

A RESTful-ish API written i Go. Thea applications has a webhook implementation, uses bearer tokens and postgres DB. During the course the API was running on Heroku.

## Reflections
Really like the conciseness of Go as a language and it feels almost efficient to write and the documentation was really good. I had some coneptual issues with the empty interface and I suspect that the way I used it was not best practices.

This was my first contact with pointers in programming and this is something I must revisit to get a better grip on.

Really fun to test a language that was totally new to me but as the deadline approached I seriously questioned why I didn't write it in JS.
